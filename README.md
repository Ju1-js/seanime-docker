# Seanime Docker

[![Docker Pulls](https://img.shields.io/docker/pulls/ju1js/seanime.svg)](https://hub.docker.com/r/ju1js/seanime)

This repository provides a simple, multi-arch Docker image for [Seanime](https://seanime.rahim.app/), a self-hosted anime streaming platform. It re-integrates [Coyenn's](https://github.com/Coyenn/seanime-docker) original image with [umag's](https://github.com/umag/seanime-docker) multi-architecture support. Video transcoding via [FFmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/) is included and works out of the box.

## Platform Support

This Docker image is built with multi-architecture support and should be compatible with the following platforms:

*   **`linux/amd64`** - For standard x86-64 PCs and servers.
*   **`linux/arm64`** - For 64-bit ARM devices like the Raspberry Pi 4 and 5.
*   **`linux/arm/v7`** - For older 32-bit ARM devices.

**Note:** While the image is built for all the above platforms, it is primarily tested and used on a Raspberry Pi 5 (`linux/arm64`). Feedback and issue reports for all platforms are highly encouraged and appreciated!

## Usage

You can run the Seanime Docker image using either the Docker command-line interface (CLI) or Docker Compose.

### Docker CLI

To quickly get started, you can use the following Docker command to run the Seanime container:

```bash
docker run -it -p 3000:8080 -p 3001:8081 --restart=always --name seanime ju1js/seanime
```

### Docker Compose

For more complex setups, it is recommended to use Docker Compose.

#### Persisting Configuration

If you want to persist your Seanime and qBittorrent settings, you'll need to use a bind mount for the `/config` directory. Before you use this volume mount in your `docker-compose.yml`, you **must** first copy the default configuration files from this repository to a folder on your host machine.

You can find the necessary files at the following location in the repository:
[**`.docker/config`**](https://github.com/Ju1-js/seanime-docker/tree/main/.docker/config) [Download](https://download-directory.github.io/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2FJu1-js%2Fseanime-docker%2Ftree%2Fmain%2F.docker%2Fconfig)

Create a folder (e.g., `seanime-config`) on your host machine and copy the contents of the repository's `.docker/config` directory into it.

#### Basic Example

Here is a basic `docker-compose.yml` file to run Seanime.

```yaml
services:
  seanime:
    image: ju1js/seanime
    container_name: seanime
    ports:
      - "3000:8080" # Seanime web interface
      - "3001:8081" # qBittorrent web interface
    volumes:
      - ./seanime-data:/data # Bind mount for downloads and media files
      # IMPORTANT: See "Persisting Configuration" above before uncommenting the next line.
      # - ./seanime-config:/config # Bind mount for configuration files
    restart: unless-stopped
```

#### Example with Wireguard

For users who want to route the container's traffic through a WireGuard VPN, you can use the following `docker-compose.yml` configuration. This is useful for enhancing privacy and bypassing network restrictions.

In this setup, the `seanime` container uses the network of the `wireguard` container.

```yaml
services:
  wireguard:
    image: lscr.io/linuxserver/wireguard:latest
    container_name: wireguard
    pull_policy: always
    cap_add:
      - NET_ADMIN
      - SYS_MODULE
    environment:
      - PUID=1000
      - PGID=1000
      - TZ=Etc/UTC
    volumes:
      - ./wireguard-config:/config # Path for WireGuard client config (e.g., wg0.conf)
      - /lib/modules:/lib/modules
    # All ports for services using WireGuard's network must be exposed here
    ports:
      - "3000:8080" # Seanime web interface
      - "3001:8081" # qBittorrent web interface
      - "51820:51820/udp" # WireGuard's own port
    sysctls:
      - net.ipv4.conf.all.src_valid_mark=1
    restart: unless-stopped

  seanime:
    image: ju1js/seanime
    container_name: seanime
    pull_policy: always
    # This container's network is handled by the wireguard service
    network_mode: "service:wireguard"
    volumes:
      - ./seanime-data:/data     # Path for downloads and media files
      # IMPORTANT: See "Persisting Configuration" above before creating this volume.
      - ./seanime-config:/config # Path for Seanime's configuration files
    # Depends on wireguard to ensure it starts first
    depends_on:
      - wireguard
    restart: unless-stopped
```

## Configuration

### Ports

*   **`8080`**: The web interface for Seanime.
*   **`8081`**: The web interface for the built-in qBittorrent client.

### Volumes

*   **`/data`**: This volume is used to store downloaded media files. You should map this to a directory on your host machine to persist your media.
*   **`/config`**: This volume stores the configuration files for Seanime, qBittorrent, and Supervisor. It is recommended to map this to a host directory to maintain your settings across container restarts.
